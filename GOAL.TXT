Network Protocol Stack (TCP/IP from scratch)
Implement TCP, IP, UDP, ARP using raw sockets or virtual interfaces.
Why it's hard:

Handle packet fragmentation, reassembly, and checksums
Implement TCP state machine (SYN, ACK, FIN, etc.)
Congestion control algorithms (slow start, congestion avoidance)
Reliable delivery over unreliable networks - retransmission, timeouts, flow control
Deal with network byte order, packet parsing, and protocol layering

First principles challenge: When you send data over the internet, it gets broken into packets, routed through multiple computers, possibly arriving out of order or not at all. TCP makes this look like a simple stream of bytes - building this teaches you how reliability emerges from unreliability.
